  <!-- Short Description -->
  <p style="font-size: 18px;"></p><strong>Hi, I'm Arpita!</strong><br>A curious and creative CSE student who loves building, learning, and always intends to grow.</p>

  <!-- Detailed Intro -->
  <p>I'm a passionate and curious 3rd year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. I love building creative and functional web projects, solving coding problems, and continuously learning new technologies. I'm also deeply interested in software development, academic research, and exploring how tech can solve real-world problems.

Currently, I'm working on projects that reflect both my technical skills and my journey as a developer. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to open-source, pursuing higher studies, and becoming a well-rounded software engineer.</p>
