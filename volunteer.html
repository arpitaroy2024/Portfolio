    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
      I volunteered at the National Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC) organized by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University. It was a great experience supporting logistics and coordination for one of the country’s top competitive programming events.
